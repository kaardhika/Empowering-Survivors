# Empowering Survivors: Analyzing Employment Data for Individuals Impacted by Sexual Slavery

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

At Transform Engine, my internship has focused on leveraging technology to create meaningful social impact specifically for those impacted by sexual slavery. Transofrm engine is a technology-based workplace that transforms the lives of survivors of modern slavery, abuse and those at higher risk of exploitation through long-term employment and support. Inspired by this work, this project analyzes data from Transform Engine. The goal is to explore trends in employment, retention rates, and skill development to better understand the social and economic impact of providing survivors with meaningful work. This analysis will help identify which factors lead to successful long-term employment and areas for improvement. By building a SQL database and performing data analysis, I aim to provide actionable insights for NGOs and social enterprises dedicated to helping survivors transition into stable, independent lives.

# BUSINESS PROBLEM

Survivors of sexual slavery face significant barriers to sustainable employment and financial independence. Transform Engineâ€™s mission is to offer long-term employment and support to these individuals, but optimizing training programs, mentorship opportunities, and career progression is critical to ensuring lasting impact. By analyzing employee data, we can determine which factors are most influential in retention and advancement, leading to improved outcomes for both the survivors and the business.

The core questions include:

    1. How does the amount of training impact retention rates?
    2. Does mentorship lead to more promotions or career growth?
    3. What demographic factors might influence success in long-term employment?

# METHODOLOGY

1. Data Collection: Use a fictional dataset representing employment records for survivors at Transform Engine, including hire dates, end dates (if applicable), hours of training, mentorship status, and promotions.
2. Data Cleaning & Transformation: Ensure the data is clean, consistent, and ready for analysis (e.g., handling missing values, normalizing training hours).
3. SQL Queries:

       Analyze retention rates based on training hours.
       Explore the correlation between mentorship and promotion opportunities.
       Examine the demographics (age, gender, etc.) that might influence success.
5. Visualization: Optional, using Python (matplotlib, seaborn) to visualize trends in the data.

# SKILLS

1. SQL: Querying and analyzing employment data (using CTEs, JOINs, aggregations, and case statements).
2. Python (optional): For advanced data visualization and further analysis.
3. Data Analysis: Identifying patterns in retention, training effectiveness, and mentorship impact.
4. Business Acumen: Connecting data insights to actionable business recommendations.
5. Problem-solving: Optimizing employee retention and growth through data-driven decision-making.

# RESULTS & BUSINESS RECOMMENDATIONS

**Key Insights:
**

    _Training & Retention_: Employees who received more than 100 hours of training had an average retention period of 3 years, 
    compared to 1.5 years for those who received less than 50 hours.
    
    _Mentorship & Promotions_: Employees who received mentorship had 30% more promotions than those who did not, 
    showing that mentorship significantly impacts career growth.
    
    _Demographics & Success_: Younger employees (18-25) showed a higher turnover rate, 
    suggesting that additional support or tailored programs may be needed for this age group.

**Business Recommendations:
**

    _Expand Training Programs_: Employees with more training show longer retention. 
    Increasing training hours can improve long-term employment outcomes.

    _Increase Mentorship Opportunities_: Mentorship has a clear impact on promotions and career satisfaction. 
    Expanding this program could help more survivors reach financial independence.
  
    _Tailor Support for Younger Employees_: Younger employees may benefit from additional support services, 
    reducing turnover and helping them grow within the company.

# NEXT STEPS

1. Further Analysis on Program Types: Conduct a deeper analysis on the types of training programs and their impact on specific skill development.
2. Emotional and Psychological Support: Investigate the effect of emotional support services on employee retention and satisfaction.
3. Scalability: Expand this model to new locations and assess the impact in different geographic regions.
