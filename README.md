# Project1

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Assume the reader won’t read everything and list everything you want them to know here! What did you accomplish and how? Tie in the skills and business impact— what do you recommend?

# BUSINESS PROBLEM

Set up the problem and what you want to accomplish. If you’re doing a fake project, make one up! Showing that you’re thinking about the business and problem will really show that you can connect the data to the real world. Bonus points if you include graphics or pictures to help set up the issue!

# METHODOLOGY

Explain high level what you did. Did you write a query? Build a dashboard? Perform statistical tests?

# SKILLS

This is where you want to include all the shiny buzzwords that recruiters will be looking for— SQL, Python, etc! What skills did you use to accomplish this? Bonus points if you go into more detail by providing specific examples and libraries like CTEs or pandas.

# RESULTS & BUSINESS RECOMMENDATIONS

Summarize what you found out, learned, or accomplished, and use visualizations when possible. Always use as many quantifiable numbers and show the business impact when you can. And think beyond dollar signs $$$— sometimes the business impact can be time or resources saved, so be sure to think through those possibilities too. And of course, providing business recommendations is what will really make you stand out. What action would you take based on what you learned? What stakeholder would be most interesting to talk to? Show you have business acumen!

# NEXT STEPS

List the next steps or things you would look into if you had more time. You always want to go the extra effort to think about the bigger picture and deeper questions. Plus, this may just convince the hiring manager to bring you on to do the next steps
